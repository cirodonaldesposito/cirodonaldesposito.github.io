Hello! I'm Ciro, a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), conducting research at the intersection of management and natural language processing (NLP). I am part of the [Entrepreneurship & Innovation](https://abs.uva.nl/content/sections/entrepeneurship-innovation/entrepreneurship-innovation.html) section, led by [Martin Obschonka](https://abs.uva.nl/profile/o/b/m.obschonka/m.obschonka.html?origin=p11pvOsST7%2BpQyiSE%2BEhzg). My Ph.D. supervisors are [Nachoem Wijnberg](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/w/i/n.m.wijnberg/n.m.wijnberg.html), [Balazs Szatmari](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/z/b.szatmari/b.szatmari.html), and [Jonathan Sitruk](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/i/j.m.c.sitruk/j.m.c.sitruk.html). I've also been a visiting scholar at the [House of Innovation](https://www.hhs.se/houseofinnovation), Stockholm School of Economics, where I collaborated with [Holmer Kok](https://www.hhs.se/en/persons/k/kok-holmer/).
