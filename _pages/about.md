I am part of the [Entrepreneurship & Innovation section](https://abs.uva.nl/content/sections/entrepeneurship-innovation/entrepreneurship-innovation.html), led by [Martin Obschonka](https://abs.uva.nl/profile/o/b/m.obschonka/m.obschonka.html?origin=p11pvOsST7%2BpQyiSE%2BEhzg). My Ph.D. supervisors are [Nachoem Wijnberg](), [Balazs Szatmari](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/z/b.szatmari/b.szatmari.html), and [Jonathan Sitruk](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/i/j.m.c.sitruk/j.m.c.sitruk.html).
