Hello! I'm Ciro, a Ph.D. student at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), conducting research at the intersection of management and natural language processing (NLP). I am part of the [Entrepreneurship & Innovation](https://abs.uva.nl/content/sections/entrepeneurship-innovation/entrepreneurship-innovation.html) section, led by [Martin Obschonka](https://abs.uva.nl/profile/o/b/m.obschonka/m.obschonka.html?origin=p11pvOsST7%2BpQyiSE%2BEhzg). My Ph.D. supervisors are [Nachoem Wijnberg](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/w/i/n.m.wijnberg/n.m.wijnberg.html), [Balazs Szatmari](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/z/b.szatmari/b.szatmari.html), and [Jonathan Sitruk](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/i/j.m.c.sitruk/j.m.c.sitruk.html). I have been a visiting scholar at the [House of Innovation](https://www.hhs.se/houseofinnovation), Stockholm School of Economics.

My research
======
My research is funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. I am interested in how we can detect emerging knowledge and how this affects venture financing, and alliance formation. Particular focus is given to text analysis.

My background

I obtained my master's degree in Economics & Finance and my bachelor's degree in Economics at the University of Pavia, [Department of Economics and Management](https://economiaemanagement.dip.unipv.it/en). My master's thesis entitled "Empirical Testing of One-Factor Capital Asset Pricing Model and Arbitrage Pricing Theory: Evidence from the Italian Stock Market" was supervised by [Enrico Cotta Ramusino](https://www.embaticinensis.eu/persone/enrico-cotta-ramusino/#:~:text=Professore%20di%20Strategia%20e%20Finanza,Universit%C3%A0%20di%20Bocconi%20di%20Milano.). During my graduate studies, I worked as an academic and private tutor, student guidance counsellor and assistant at the secretarial office of the University of Pavia. I also have professional working experience as an intern in public administration.
